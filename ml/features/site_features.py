"""AgniNetra AI - Site-level spatiotemporal feature engineering.

Classification happens at the level of a *site*, not a pixel. A single VIIRS
detection carries almost no information about what produced it: a refinery flare
and a burning field can look nearly identical in one frame. What separates them is
behaviour over time - does this location burn every night for months, or once?

So the pipeline is:

    detections -> DBSCAN spatial clustering -> per-site temporal statistics
               -> real distances to OSM infrastructure -> features

All distance computations use a BallTree with the haversine metric, which is
O(n log n). The previous per-row Python loop was O(n-squared) and would not finish
on a national-scale detection archive.
