"""AgniNetra AI - Programmatic weak supervision for thermal anomaly labelling.

No hand-labelled dataset exists for Indian industrial thermal sources, and manually
labelling enough VIIRS detections to train a classifier is not feasible. Instead this
module derives *noisy but independent* labels from evidence external to the model's
own feature set:

  * OpenStreetMap infrastructure geometry (refineries, works, power plants, quarries)
  * Multi-night temporal persistence of the detection site itself
  * Physical thermal signature (I-4 / I-5 brightness separation, FRP magnitude)
  * Land-cover class and agricultural burning seasonality

Each labelling function (LF) votes for one class or ABSTAINs. Votes are resolved by
priority-weighted majority. Sites where the LFs disagree, or where no LF fires, are
left UNLABELLED and excluded from training - they are not forced into a class.

This is the standard Snorkel-style weak supervision pattern. The labels are noisy;
that is expected. Evaluation must be done against a held-out set of manually
verified sites, never against these labels.
